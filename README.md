AI-Powered Melodies Generation (Melodies-AI) ðŸŽ¶


This project focuses on generating musical melodies using an AI model based on the LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) architecture with attention mechanisms. The model has been trained on the MAESTRO dataset to generate sequences of musical notes in MIDI format.

Key Features:
LSTM with Attention Mechanism: Improves the understanding of temporal dependencies in music data.
MIDI File Support: Processes MIDI files to generate new melodies and allows exporting the output.
Interactive Interface: Streamlit-based application for customizing parameters like temperature and prediction length.

Use Case:
Generate unique melodies for creative projects or as inspiration for composers.
